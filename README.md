# Simple Operating System Project Report

## Overview
This repository contains the project report and related materials for the Operating Systems course (CO2017). The project demonstrates the design and implementation of a basic operating system, covering various fundamental concepts and features of operating systems.

## Contents
- **[Documentation](#)**: Additional documents that provide insights into the design and usage of the operating system.
- **[Report](#)**: Detailed documentation and analysis of the project.
- **[Source Code](#)**: Implementation of different components of the operating system.

## Features
This project covers the following key features:
- **Process Management**: Implementation of process creation, scheduling, and termination.
- **Memory Management**: Techniques for memory allocation, paging, and segmentation.
- **File System**: Basic file system implementation to handle file operations.
- **Device Drivers**: Simple drivers to interface with hardware components.
- **Inter-Process Communication**: Mechanisms for processes to communicate and synchronize with each other.

## Technologies Used
